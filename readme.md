# Simple Voice AI

This is my first time working with python and also my first time working with machine learning

before you run the program, install python3 and run the command pip install SpeechRecognition.
You will also need to install pyaudio and portaudio.
To use the openAi version you need to install the openai module as well.

I use the classical method of trail and error
